# Memory Game on React

![Gif](memorygame.gif)

This project was a test assigment I found on one chats dedicated to JS. It is still WIP - I'm planning to connect timer to the card grid, so the time starts when the person clicks on the first card and ends when the game is finished. 

##### I wrote it using modern hooks syntax. I acquired some knowledge about css flip animations and experimented technologies (such as preserve-3d and visibiility-hidden) and dwelled deeper into useState and useEffect hooks.
